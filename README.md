Socket Stoke
============

Socket Stoke is a modified version of [STOKE](https://github.com/StanfordPL/stoke) that utilizes socket communication to interact with a Python server. It facilitates the transmission of CPU state and assembly information to a Python server named [StokeGym](https://github.com/kc-ml2/StokeGym). To get started with Socket Stoke, refer to the environment setup instructions provided in the [StokeGym repository](https://github.com/kc-ml2/StokeGym).
